# Portfolio-Simple-Website
This is a basic personal portfolio website built using only HTML and CSS. The project includes two main pages: a Home page to introduce yourself and a Contact page with a simple layout to showcase basic form structure.  It is designed for beginners looking to practice front-end development without involving JavaScript or any frameworks.
